A script designed to give information about MWRTA buses close to the 
Mathworks from the MWRTA mobile site, get a representative static image from 
Google maps, and calculate an estimated ETA using the Google distance matrix API.

Uses BeautifulSoup for parsing, Pillow for image loading, and Tkinter for 
windows.
